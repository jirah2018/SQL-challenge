# SQL-challenge


***EmployeeSQL***

The EmployeeSQL folder contains two SQL files (table_schemata.sql and employee_queries.sql):

-The table_schemata.sql file builds a relational database which contains tables that hold employees related data from imported csv files. Relationships are defined between tables and columns using primary keys, composite keys and foreign keys.

-The employee_queries.sql file quries the desired employee information.

***Entity Relationship Diagram***

The employeeSQL - ERD.png visually displays the structure of the tables and relationships between logically related tables of the database (This ERD was sketched using QuickDBD).
